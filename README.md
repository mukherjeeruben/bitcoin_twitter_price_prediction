Cryptocurrency price forecasting became one of the complex problems in the industry given the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices
in the market, the fluctuations are dependent on various factors like market conditions , sentiments in the market and not the historical prices alone. 
Such a type of data needs a model that can handle complex data and still produce great prediction results. This paper proposes a system developed using LSTMs to
predict the Bitcoin prices based on historical prices of bitcoin and the point in time sentiments present in the market. The performance of the
proposed system is measured and compared with those of the conventional machine learning algorithms used for prediction like linear
regression and decision tree regressor. The experiment proved that LSTMs performed far better than the state of art models and was able to
handle the complex non-linear nature of Bitcoin price data and the sentiments data present in the market from twitter. It was found that there exists a 
relationship between the sentiments in the market and fluctuations in bitcoin prices given the nature of sentiment that is positive or negative.
